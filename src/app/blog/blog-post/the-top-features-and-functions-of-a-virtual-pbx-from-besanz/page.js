</h1>

                    <p>
                    If you are looking for a modern, efficient, and cost-effective way to manage your business
                    communication, you might want to consider switching to a virtual PBX system from Besanz. A virtual PBX is a cloud-based phone system that uses the internet to connect your calls, instead of relying on physical wires and hardware. It offers many advantages over traditional PBX
                    systems, such as scalability, mobility, reliability, and security.


                    </p>

                    

                    <h2 className={styles.blTitle}>Call Management</h2>

                    <p>
                    One of the basic functions of any phone system is to manage incoming and outgoing calls. A virtual PBX system allows you to do that with ease and flexibility. You can set up call forwarding, call blocking, call transfer, call waiting, caller ID, do not disturb, and more. 
                    You can also create ring groups, which are groups of extensions that ring simultaneously or sequentially when a call comes in. This way, you can ensure that no call goes unanswered or gets lost in voicemail.
                    </p>

                  <p>
                  Another feature that enhances call management is the auto-attendant. This is a virtual
                  receptionist that greets callers with a customized message and directs them to the right person or department using voice prompts or dial-by-name directories. The auto-attendant can also provide information such as business hours, location, or special offers.

                  </p>

                  <h2 className={styles.blTitle}>Local Connection</h2>

                  <p>A virtual PBX system from Besanz allows you to have a local presence in any market you want
                    to reach. You can choose from a variety of local, toll-free, or international phone numbers for
                    your business. You can also port your existing numbers to your virtual PBX provider. Having a local number can help you build trust and credibility with your customers and prospects, as well as save money on long-distance charges.


                  </p>

                   <p>
                   Another feature that enables local connection is conference calling. You can host or join audio or video conferences with multiple participants using your virtual PBX system. You can also share your screen, files, or chat messages during the conference. Conference calling can help you collaborate with your team members, partners, or clients across different locations.
                   </p>


                  <h2 className={styles.blTitle}>Remote Office</h2>

                  <p>A virtual PBX system from Besanz gives you the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere. You can access your phone system from any device that has an internet connection, such as a desk phone, a computer, or a smartphone. You can also use a softphone app that turns your device into a virtual extension of your phone system. 
                    This way, you can make and receive calls using your business number, regardless of where you are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Another feature that supports remote work is voicemail transcription. This feature converts your voicemail messages into text and send them to your email or SMS. 
                  This way, you can read your messages without having to listen to them, which can save you time and hassle. You can also reply to your messages faster and more conveniently.

                  </p>

                  <h2 className={styles.blTitle}>Customer Satisfaction</h2>

                  <p>A virtual PBX system can help you improve your customer satisfaction by providing them with a better calling experience. 
                    You can use features such as call recording, call monitoring, call analytics, and call queues to enhance your customer service.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Call recording allows you to record and store your calls for quality assurance, training, or
                  compliance purposes. You can also listen to your recordings anytime and anywhere.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Call monitoring allows you to listen in on live calls without being noticed by the callers. You can
                  also whisper to your agents or barge in on the calls if needed. This feature can help you coach
                  your agents, resolve issues, or handle difficult situations.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Call analytics allows you to track and measure various metrics related to your calls, such as call
                  volume, duration, outcome, rating, etc. You can also generate reports and graphs to visualize
                  your data and identify trends and patterns.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Call queues allow you to manage high call volumes by placing callers in a queue until an agent
                  becomes available. You can also play music or messages while they wait or offer them the option to leave a voicemail or request a callback.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  These are just some of the top features and functions of a virtual PBX from Besanz that you
                  should know about. There are many more features that can help you customize your phone
                  system according to your needs and preferences. A virtual PBX system can provide you with
                  many benefits over traditional PBX systems, such as lower costs, higher efficiency, greater
                  flexibility, and better customer service.
