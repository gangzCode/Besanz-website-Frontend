                    <p>
                    Business phone systems are essential for any organization that wants to communicate effectively with customers, partners, and employees. However, not all business phone systems are created equal. Some are outdated, expensive, and difficult to manage, while others are modern, affordable, and easy to use. We will compare different types of business phone systems and show you how cloud-based solutions like Besanz can help you unleash the power of the cloud for your business communication needs.

                    <h2 className={styles.blTitle}>What are Business Phone Systems?</h2>

                    <p>Business phone systems are software or hardware solutions that allow you to make and receive calls, send and receive messages, and manage various communication features for your business. They can be categorized into three main types:
</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">Traditional PBX:</h4>

                    <p>This is the oldest and most common type of business phone system. It uses a physical box that connects your phone lines and extensions to a central switchboard. It offers basic features like call forwarding, voicemail, and caller ID, but it requires a lot of maintenance, wiring, and hardware upgrades. It also has limited scalability and mobility options.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">VoIP: </h4>

                    <p>This is a newer and more advanced type of business phone system. It uses the internet to transmit voice and data packets over IP networks. It offers more features than traditional PBX, such as video conferencing, online faxing, SMS, and integrations with other software applications. It also has lower costs, higher quality, and greater flexibility than traditional PBX. However, it still requires some hardware devices, such as IP phones or adapters, and it depends on the reliability and speed of your internet connection.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">Cloud:</h4>

                    <p>This is the latest and most innovative type of business phone system. It uses cloud computing to host and manage all the communication features and functions on a remote server. It offers all the benefits of VoIP, plus more features like artificial intelligence, team collaboration, analytics, and security. It also has no hardware requirements, no installation costs, no maintenance fees, and no contracts. You can access your cloud phone system from any device, anywhere, anytime.</p>
