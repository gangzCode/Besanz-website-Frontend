          "If you make a VoIP 9-1-1 emergency call, BESANZ will attempt to automatically route your 9-1-1 call, through a third-party call center opertor, to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) corresponding to your 9-1-1 address of record in the BESANZ portal. However, due to the limitations of the VoIP 9-1-1 emergency call service, your 9-1-1 call may be routed to a different location than that which would be used for traditional 9-1-1 emergency call. For example, your call will be forwarded to a third-party call center that handles emergency calls. This call center is different from the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) that answers a traditional 9-1-1 emergency call which has automatically generated 9-1-1 address information. Consequently, you will be required to provide your name, address, and telephone number to the third-party call center operator."

However, for technical reasons, the dispatcher receiving the call may not be able to capture or retain your name, address, or phone number. When making a 9-1-1 emergency call, be prepared to immediately provide your name, address, and phone number, or the location of the emergency if it is different from your location, as the operator may not have this information. If you are unable to speak, the dispatcher may not be able to locate you if your 9-1-1 address of record in the BESANZ portal is incorrect."

If you do not correctly provide your name, civic address, and phone number during a 9-1-1 emergency call, or if your 9-1-1 address of record in the BESANZ portal is incorrect, 9-1-1 calls may be misdirected to an incorrect emergency response site. For example, if you change the address from which you use the BESANZ VoIP service, access to the VoIP 9-1-1 emergency call Service will not function properly. Upon moving to a new address, or a change of use of phone service, you must update your 9-1-1 address of record in your BESANZ portal.

According to telecom decision CRTC 2005-21, this type of telephone service is  classified as a Nomadic or Fixed Non-Native VoIP service due to the fact that the  endpoint (phone) location may change. BESANZ provides CUSTOMER and CUSTOMER End Users  with access to VoIP 9-1-1 emergency call services in accordance with this regulation,  so long as it remains in effect. BESANZ will continue to follow industry regulations,  guidance and best practices for the proper handling and treatment of 9-1-1 emergency  services for Nomadic and Fixed Non-Native VoIP Services as they evolve and are  adopted by the industry.",

When CUSTOMER and CUSTOMER End Users  make an BESANZ VoIP 9-1-1 emergency call, CUSTOMER and CUSTOMER End Users must verbally  provide the operator with the CUSTOMER's / CUSTOMER End User's' name, address, and phone  number to ensure that the emergency services operator can route the call to the  appropriate local 9-1-1 response centre serving the geographical area where the caller  is located.",

If CUSTOMER or CUSTOMER End Users make a remote VoIP-based 9-1-1 emergency call (i.e. a call made  from outside the local area network), from outside Canada, or from a location within  Canada that is not served by 9-1-1, the operator will not be able to complete this 9-1-1 emergency call",
